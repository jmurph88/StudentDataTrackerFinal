# StudentDataTrackerFinal

This project was created for my C# class. 

It is a console application that tracks students' first and last name, teacher name and four quiz scores. The user is able to add and delete students, print a list of the data and edit quiz scores. The data is then saved in a csv file for future use.

It was created using Visual Studio. The project can be excuted by opening the files in Visual Studio and running the solution.
